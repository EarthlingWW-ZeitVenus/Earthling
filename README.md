# About myself
My real name is Dmitriy. I currently live in Russia.

My main goal is to promote a new paradigm of human coexistence on Earth. And all other goals are the stages necessary to achieve the main goal.

New Paradigm - based on a holistic worldview. This is a new way of thinking, a new way to act and react to the surrounding reality. A new way of human coexistence on the planet - without countries, politics, competition and wars (conventional and economic). My understanding of the world has found an intersection in many points with such scientific documentaries as Zeitgeist (all three parts), Thrive, Crossroads, Down The Rabbit Hole...

Also i have ideas and developments on the following:

New Economic Model - new way of managing the planet's resources and human self-realization in the context of this.

New Open Enterprice Model (without directors, model based on a generally accepted (consensus method) decision-making algorithm).

For me, web programming is a tool for implementing even my most intricate ideas.

I would like to find people ideologically close to me here (in Github) and cooperate with them to create global ideological projects.
This does not mean that we will not earn anything from this, it means that the main thing will be the promotion of the idea, and not the maximization of profits
